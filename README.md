## PWP Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
+1 for the fully-responsive HTML wireframe!

Your focus and clarity of purpose are great - you are ready to begin the development phase of your project. Your HTML and CSS code look good too. I'm interested to see your UI design choices. 

If you're interested in looking ahead, here's our content covering how we will be handling the [PWP Contact Form](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/). Since your PWP is a one-pager - no need to template your project. We'll be talking more about these aspects come next week.

Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric). Nice work. You are clear to begin development on your PWP.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- The "Bootstrap Optional Theme" CSS should be loaded after the core Bootstrap CSS. (Move line 9 down after line 12)
- The final closing &lt;main&gt; tag on line 147 should be a &lt;div&gt;. This would close your &lt;div class="sfooter-content"&gt; properly. But considering you have no &lt;footer&gt; proper, you don't really need this tag at all actually.
